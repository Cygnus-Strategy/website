    <p>We hold the security and privacy of our clients in the highest regard. 
        Maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of all data
         that we handle is paramount.</p>
    <p>Our consultancy operates within a robust and proactive information
         security framework designed in alignment with NIST recommendations.
         All information, whether electronic or physical, is secured through
         multiple layers of protective measures that include encryption, 
         secure networks, and advanced access control mechanisms.
         We adhere strictly to the principle of data minimization, 
         collecting and processing only the information necessary
         during an engagement. Once the data lifecycle completes its course,
          we employ secure data disposal methods.</p>
    <p>We will never share your information with anyone without your explicit
         permission. We will never sell your information to anyone.</p>
    <p>We are happy to utilize client-provided hardware. We <i>strongly</i>
         prefer Unix or Unix-like operating systems (macOS, Linux, BSD), 
         but we are happy to work with Windows systems as well.</p>
    <p>A full copy of our information security and privacy policy is available
         by request.</p>
